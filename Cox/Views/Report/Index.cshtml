<h2>Individual Learning Plan</h2>
<p>
    Thank you for completing the Order Management Learning Assessment!  Based on your responses, 
    your Individual Learning Plan (ILP) includes only the learning activities you need to complete for 
    a successful transition to your new role as an Order Management Specialist.
</p>
<p>
    Required learning activities in your ILP that you need to complete are identified with an ⌧ for every OM product, 
    process, and tool task. Learning activities include completing courses in Cox U and customized self-directed activities 
    as outlined in the Self-Directed Learning Guide for In-Market Order Management Specialists. In areas where you are already 
    proficient, a ☐ identifies optional learning activities.
</p>
<p>
    All learning activities must be completed in consultation with your Supervisor.  Download or email your ILP using the tools on this page, 
    and share a copy with your Supervisor.
